🚇 Delhi Metro Route Optimization System (C++)

A graph-based route optimization system built in C++ to compute the shortest metro route and fare between two stations using classic Data Structures and Algorithms.
The project models a real-world metro network and applies Dijkstra’s Algorithm, priority queues (min-heaps), and graph traversal techniques to deliver accurate and efficient results.

📌 Problem Statement

Navigating a large metro network efficiently requires identifying the shortest possible route between two stations while considering distances and travel cost.

This project solves the problem by:

Modeling metro stations as nodes

Modeling metro routes as weighted edges

Computing the shortest path between source and destination

Calculating the fare based on total travel distance

🎯 Project Objectives

Apply graph data structures to a real-world transportation problem

Implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path computation

Use priority queues (min-heaps) for performance optimization

Compare BFS and DFS traversal strategies

Demonstrate clean, modular, and maintainable C++ code

Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Priority Queue (Min-Heap)

BFS & DFS

Tools:

VS Code

Git & GitHub

🧠 System Design Overview
Graph Representation

Each metro station is represented as a node

Each route between stations is a weighted edge

Graph is implemented using an adjacency list for memory efficiency

Station A ----(distance)---- Station B

⚙️ Algorithms Used
1️⃣ Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Core Algorithm)

Used to compute the shortest path between two stations in a weighted graph.

Why Dijkstra?

Metro routes have different distances

BFS fails for weighted graphs

Guarantees shortest path efficiently

Time Complexity:

O((V + E) log V) using min-heap

2️⃣ Priority Queue (Min-Heap)

Used to:

Always process the station with the minimum current distance

Optimize Dijkstra’s performance

Implemented using C++ STL:

priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> pq;

3️⃣ BFS & DFS (Traversal Comparison)

Implemented to analyze route exploration behavior

Helps understand why BFS/DFS are not suitable for weighted shortest-path problems

Algorithm	Suitable for Shortest Path
BFS	❌ (only unweighted graphs)
DFS	❌
Dijkstra	✅
💰 Fare Calculation Logic

Total fare is calculated based on the sum of distances along the shortest path

Demonstrates real-world application of algorithm output

Example:

Total Distance: 18 km
Fare: ₹45
